# About
Personal Dietary Manager Application. The objective of this project is to create a personal dietary manager application to help an individual manage their food consumption. The user will be able to add every food item he/she wants to eat. The app has the functionality to classify the item into the food group it belongs to. The app also calculates the total calorie and nutrition intake per day based on the type of food user consumes.

This product is a desktop application and does not require any internet connection, but users can synchronize their data when there is an active internet connection.
